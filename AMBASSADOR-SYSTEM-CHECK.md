- 🥈 **Silver** (6-10 sales): 15% commission  
- 🥇 **Gold** (11+ sales): 20% commission

### Calculation
- Commission = Sale Amount × Tier Rate
- Example: $500 sale at Bronze = $50 commission
- Tier upgrades apply to ALL future sales

## Known Limitations

### 1. localStorage Dependency
- ⚠️ Data only exists in browser localStorage
- ⚠️ Clearing browser data = losing all ambassador data
- ⚠️ Different browsers/devices don't sync
- ⚠️ No backup unless manually exported

**Workaround**: 
- Export ambassador codes regularly
- Keep backup in spreadsheet
- Use same browser/device for admin tasks

### 2. Manual Payment Confirmation
- ⚠️ Admin must manually confirm when customer pays
- ⚠️ No automatic payment integration
- ⚠️ Commission not calculated until manual confirmation

**Workaround**:
- Check payment apps daily
- Update admin dashboard promptly
- Keep payment records separate

### 3. No Real-Time Sync
- ⚠️ Portal doesn't auto-update when new sale confirmed
- ⚠️ Ambassador must refresh page to see updates

**Workaround**:
- Tell ambassadors to refresh portal regularly
- Update sales in batches (weekly)
